# CLA Assistant Workflow
#
# This workflow checks that contributors have signed the Contributor License Agreement.
# Signatures are stored in `signatures/cla.json` in this repository.
#
# Required secret:
#   CLA_ASSISTANT_PAT — a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope.
#   Add it under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.
#   Without this secret, the action cannot commit new signatures to the repo.
#
# To re-trigger the CLA check on an existing PR, post a comment with the text: recheck
