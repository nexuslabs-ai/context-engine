## 3. Representations

By submitting a Contribution, you represent that:

1. **You are legally entitled** to grant the licenses above. If you are employed, either your employer has waived its rights to your Contribution, or you have obtained permission from your employer to submit it.

2. **Each Contribution is your original creation.** You have not copied it from another source without permission, and it is not subject to third-party intellectual property claims that would conflict with this CLA.

3. **Your Contribution does not violate any third-party rights**, including copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret rights.

4. **You understand that your Contribution may be made public** and that a record of it (including any personal information you provide) will be maintained indefinitely.

## 4. Outbound License

You acknowledge that Nexus Labs may license your Contributions under:

- The **GNU Affero General Public License v3** (AGPL v3), which is the current license for this project
- Any **future version of AGPL** published by the Free Software Foundation
- A **commercial or proprietary license** for the purpose of dual-licensing, allowing Nexus Labs to offer Context Engine under different terms to commercial customers

This does not limit the rights granted to the open source community under AGPL v3.

## 5. No Warranty

Your Contributions are provided **"as-is"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. You are not required to provide support for your Contributions.
