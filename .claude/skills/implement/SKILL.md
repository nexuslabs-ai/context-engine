# Implement

## Purpose

Implement features and tasks with production-quality code, following codebase conventions and best practices. Works with any context source.

## When to Use

- Implementing new features (from any source)
- Building new components, hooks, or utilities
- Adding functionality to existing code
- Any task that requires writing code

## Context Sources

This skill works with multiple input types:

| Source            | Detection                  | How to Extract                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub issue**  | `#123` or GitHub issue URL | `gh issue view 123 --json number,title,body,labels,state,url` |
| **Markdown file** | `.md` file path referenced | Read the file content                                         |
| **Conversation**  | Requirements in chat       | Parse from conversation history                               |

## Task-Specific Rules

Based on what you're implementing, load these rules **before writing any code**:

| Task Type | Detect By          | Rules to Load                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core      | `packages/core/`   | [context-engine.md](../../rules/context-engine.md), [testing.md](../../rules/testing.md)                   |
| Database  | `packages/db/`     | [context-engine-database.md](../../rules/context-engine-database.md), [testing.md](../../rules/testing.md) |
| Server    | `packages/server/` | [context-engine-api.md](../../rules/context-engine-api.md), [testing.md](../../rules/testing.md)           |

**Always also load:** Base rules (workflow, github)

## Agent Delegation

Implementation phases are delegated to the **SDE2 agent** for strict convention adherence.

### Flow

```
Coordinator → Spawn SDE2 "implement phase X" → SDE2 implements → Returns result → Show user → User feedback → Spawn/Resume SDE2 with feedback
```

### How It Works

| Step | Actor       | Action                                                                               |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Coordinator | Gathers requirements, creates todo list, gets user approval on plan                  |
| 2    | Coordinator | Spawns SDE2 agent for first implementation phase                                     |
| 3    | SDE2        | Implements the phase following all conventions                                       |
| 4    | SDE2        | Returns summary with code snippets and file:line refs                                |
| 5    | Coordinator | Relays summary to user                                                               |
| 6    | User        | Reviews, provides feedback or approves                                               |
| 7    | Coordinator | If changes needed: resume SDE2 with feedback. If approved: spawn SDE2 for next phase |

### SDE2 Task Prompt Template

```
Implement phase: {phase_name}

Context:
- Spec/ticket: {reference}
- Todo: {current todo item}
- Rules to follow: {list of rule files}

Requirements:
{phase-specific requirements}

After completion, provide:
1. Summary table of changes (file | change)
2. Key code snippets with file:line references
3. Any issues encountered
```

### When to Resume vs New Spawn

| Situation                              | Action                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User requests changes to current phase | Resume same SDE2 agent with feedback  |
| Moving to next phase                   | Spawn new SDE2 agent                  |
| Bug fix in previously completed phase  | Spawn new SDE2 agent with fix context |

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Gather Requirements

1. **Detect context source:**

   ```
   If #123 or GitHub issue URL → Fetch GitHub issue
   If .md file referenced → Read markdown file
   Otherwise → Use conversation context
   ```

2. **If GitHub issue:**

   ```bash
   gh issue view 123 --json number,title,body,labels,state,url
   ```

   - Extract requirements and acceptance criteria from issue body
   - Check for linked designs or references in issue comments

3. **If Markdown file:**
   - Read the referenced file
   - Extract requirements and acceptance criteria

4. **If conversation context:**
   - Summarize what the user is asking for
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements before proceeding

5. **Extract key information:**
   - What needs to be built?
   - Acceptance criteria (explicit or inferred)
   - Any design references?
   - Constraints or dependencies?

### Phase 2: Explore Existing Code

1. **Find similar implementations:**
   - How do existing features in this codebase work?
   - What patterns are already established?

2. **Identify dependencies:**
   - What existing utilities/hooks can be reused?
   - Are there shared types to extend?

3. **Note the file structure:**
   - Where should new files go?
   - What's the naming convention?

### Phase 3: Research Dependencies (MANDATORY)

**Before writing any code, research any third-party dependencies you'll be using.**

1. **Identify what you'll use:**
   - What libraries/frameworks does this feature require?
   - Any new dependencies being introduced?
   - Any existing dependencies you're unfamiliar with?

2. **Research each one:**

   ```
   "{library} best practices {current year}"
   "{library} {version} documentation"
   "{library} common mistakes"
   ```

3. **Verify correct usage:**
   - How should this library be used?
   - Are there configuration options to consider?
   - What are common pitfalls to avoid?

4. **Document findings:**
   - Note any important discoveries
   - Include in implementation plan if relevant

### Phase 4: Create Implementation Plan

1. **Use TodoWrite to create task list:**
   - Break down into small, testable chunks
   - Each todo should be completable independently
   - Include testing as explicit todos

2. **Example plan structure:**

   ```
   - [ ] Create main implementation file
   - [ ] Add core functionality
   - [ ] Add tests/stories
   - [ ] Update exports
   ```

3. **WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding**

### Phase 5: Implement

1. **Work through todos one at a time:**
   - Mark todo as `in_progress` before starting
   - Mark as `completed` immediately after finishing
   - Summarize what was done after each

2. **Follow the loaded rules strictly:**
   - Rules files contain all conventions
   - Don't deviate from established patterns
   - Include proper TypeScript types

3. **After each significant change:**
   - Provide summary with code snippets
   - Include file:line references
   - WAIT for user confirmation

### Phase 6: Verify & Test

1. **Run relevant checks:**

   ```bash
   yarn typecheck          # TypeScript
   yarn lint               # ESLint
   yarn test               # All tests
   ```

2. **Fix any issues found**

3. **Verify against acceptance criteria:**
   - Does implementation meet all requirements?
   - Any edge cases missed?

## Output Format

After implementation is complete:

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

### Task Reference

{Include whichever applies:}

- **GitHub Issue:** #123 - {title}
- **Spec:** {filename.md}
- **Request:** {brief summary of what was asked}

### Changes Made

| File                    | Change        |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| `path/to/file.tsx`      | {description} |
| `path/to/file.test.tsx` | {description} |

### Key Code

{Relevant code snippets with file:line references}

### Verification

- [ ] TypeScript: No errors
- [ ] Lint: No warnings
- [ ] Tests: All passing
- [ ] Requirements: Met

### Next Steps

{Any follow-up items or notes for the user}
```

## Principles to Follow

1. **Read before write** — Understand existing patterns first
2. **Research before coding** — Don't guess how libraries work; look them up
3. **Follow loaded rules** — Rules files are the source of truth for conventions
4. **Ask when unsure** — Better to clarify than assume
5. **Small iterations** — Complete one todo, summarize, wait for confirmation
6. **Context-agnostic** — Same quality regardless of input source
