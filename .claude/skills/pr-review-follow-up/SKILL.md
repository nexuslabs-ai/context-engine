# PR Review Follow-up

## Purpose

Re-review a pull request after the author has pushed changes in response to initial review feedback. Verify that previous issues are fixed and check for any new issues introduced.

## When to Use

- After initial PR review when changes have been pushed
- When verifying review feedback has been addressed
- When re-evaluating a PR after modifications

## Prerequisites

- Previous review must exist (from pr-review skill)
- Get previous issues from PR comments, review thread, or conversation history

## Follow-up Process

1. **Gather previous issues**
   - List all blocking and minor issues from previous review
   - Note the file:line locations

2. **Identify changed files**
   - Get commits since last review
   - List files modified since last review

3. **Research dependencies (if applicable)**
   - If fixes involve third-party libraries, verify against latest documentation
   - Use WebSearch to confirm fixes align with correct usage patterns
   - Check for any new recommendations since initial review
   - This is especially important if initial review raised concerns about library usage

4. **Verify previous issues**
   - For each previous issue, check if it's addressed
   - Mark status using indicators below
   - For API-related fixes, verify against researched best practices

5. **Review new changes only**
   - Don't re-review unchanged code
   - Focus on files modified since last review
   - Check for new issues introduced by fixes

6. **Apply verdict logic**
   - Use follow-up verdict guidelines below

## Status Indicators

| Status             | Meaning                           | When to Use                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✅ Fixed           | Issue has been addressed          | Code changed correctly         |
| ❌ Still Present   | Issue remains unchanged           | No change or wrong change      |
| ⚠️ Partially Fixed | Attempted but incomplete          | Some aspects fixed, others not |
| 🔄 Changed         | Code changed, needs re-evaluation | Different approach taken       |

## Dependency Research in Follow-ups

Research is required in follow-up reviews when:

| Condition                                      | Research Action                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Initial review flagged incorrect library usage | Verify fix against latest docs      |
| Fix changed how a dependency is used           | Confirm usage is correct per docs   |
| New dependency added in the fix                | Full research on new dependency     |
| Fix involves library configuration             | Verify configuration is appropriate |

### Verification Checklist

When fixes involve third-party dependencies:

- [ ] Fix aligns with current official documentation
- [ ] Library is being used as intended
- [ ] No common mistakes introduced in the fix
- [ ] Any new usage patterns are correct

## Smart Agent Selection

For follow-up reviews, not all agents need to re-review:

| Condition                                  | Agents Used                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Only code fixes (same files modified)      | SDE2 only                  |
| New files added                            | SDE2 + Principal Architect |
| Significant structural changes             | SDE2 + Principal Architect |
| Previous review had architectural concerns | SDE2 + Principal Architect |

## Posting the Review

When posting via `gh api`, use **both** the body and inline comments:

### Review Body (`body` parameter)

Use the output format above for the overall follow-up summary.

### Inline Comments (`comments` parameter)

Add inline comments for:

- **Still present issues:** Comment on the same line explaining what's still wrong
- **New issues found:** Comment on the specific line with the new issue

```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/utils/format.ts",
      "line": 15,
      "body": "❌ **Still Present:** This issue from the previous review hasn't been addressed. The null check is still missing."
    },
    {
      "path": "src/components/button.tsx",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "⚠️ **New Issue:** This was introduced in the fix - consider using optional chaining here."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Review Event

| Condition                              | Event             |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| All issues fixed, no new issues        | `APPROVE`         |
| Issues fixed, only minor new issues    | `COMMENT`         |
| Blocking issues remain OR new blockers | `REQUEST_CHANGES` |

## Follow-up Verdict Guidelines

### SDE2 Verdict Logic

| Condition                                            | Verdict            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| All previous blocking issues fixed, no new issues    | `APPROVED`         |
| Previous issues fixed, only minor new issues         | `MINOR CHANGES`    |
| Blocking issues still present OR new blocking issues | `CHANGES REQUIRED` |

### Principal Architect Verdict Logic

| Condition                                 | Verdict            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Previous architectural concerns addressed | `APPROVED`         |
| Minor questions remain, non-blocking      | `NEEDS DISCUSSION` |
| Significant architectural issues remain   | `CHANGES REQUIRED` |

## When Principal Architect Skips Follow-up

Principal Architect only needs to re-review when:

- New files were added since last review
- Significant structural changes detected
- Previous review had architectural concerns

If none of these apply, SDE2 handles the follow-up alone.
